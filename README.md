# Small Business Network Topology (Cisco Packet Tracer)

This project features a simulated **small business network topology** designed and configured in **Cisco Packet Tracer**. It includes a fully functional VLAN setup for logical network segmentation.

## üìÇ Project Files
- **SmallBusinessTopology.pkt**: The Cisco Packet Tracer file containing the complete network simulation.

## üó∫Ô∏è Topology Overview
- Multiple VLANs configured for separation of departments (e.g., Admin, HR, IT).
- Inter-VLAN routing using a router-on-a-stick.
- DHCP configuration for dynamic IP addressing.
- Basic security configurations on switches and routers.

## ‚úÖ Requirements
- **Cisco Packet Tracer** (Version X.X or later) to open and interact with the `.pkt` file.

## üöÄ How to Use
1. Download the `.pkt` file from this repository.
2. Open it using Cisco Packet Tracer.
3. Explore the topology, device configurations, and VLANs.
4. Modify and expand the topology as needed.
